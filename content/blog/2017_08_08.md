Last week was my week off before starting work! It feels just like a break week- and I used the time to recharge!

Friday was Graduation. It was adorable and short. The speeches were good, there was a lot of tears, and many hugs.

On Saturday I woke up and headed to Summer Soul! Kerry, a friend from undergrad, and Cojo came too. I love those yoga sessions so much. The ladies who run it are amazing, and I will go to as many as possible for ever.

Kerry is a travel PT and she's currently stationed ~1hour from Denver. We plan on taking advantage of that! Sunday she came back out for a hike. Chief Mountain was awesome. After, we stopped in Idaho Springs for a late lunch. Westdown & Bound was a great spot.

Monday Zac headed off to St. Louis, his current work location, and I got my hair done - and read by the pool. Monday night was CRAFT NIGHT! It was so great to catch up with the ladies. I borrowed one of Cojo's books to practice some calligraphy. I wanted to bring a healthy snack, so I made the coconut bark from TIU. It was delicious! It took my food processor for-ever, and I was worried it wouldn't work out.. but it did!

Tuesday morning I woke up and headed out for some errands. My *the-one-thing-I'll-buy-when-I-get-a-job* was towels. I've had mine for a long time, and it was something nice that I never justified spending money on. SO- off to Bed Bath & Beyond I went. THEY ARE SO AMAZING.

Wednesday Rex and I met up with Cheryl to get some work done. She works from home, and it's nice to get out and work in public once in a while. We stopped at two coffee shops that didn't have decent wifi outside (dogs) and ended up at Starbucks/REI. We were there until lunch, and I accomplished a lot (added a feature to my capstone)!

That night I headed to Kindness for a restoration yoga class. It was amazing to be back in the studio.

Thursday I pretty much just spent the day at the pool. I also got my new calligraphy book in the mail, so I spent some time working with that.

Friday, Kerry headed down after work. We were doing yoga in the morning, and she forgot her mat- so it was a perfect opportunity for me to go grab a travel mat!

We went to Williams & Graham for drinks, and I stopped for ice cream on the way home (THESE TWO ARE CRAZY FOR NOT GETTING SOME).

Saturday, BRIGHT & EARLY, Kerry and I headed to RED ROCKS for yoga. IT WAS AMAZING. I hope to grab season tickets next year! I highly recommend it.

While we were at yoga, Zac played tennis. So we all crashed for a family nap mid day.

Saturday afternoon, we went to a housewarming party. It was so great to see some friends from g46.

Sunday was all about self-care-sunday. It was rainy out- so we had a really great brunch. I love making omlettes with bacon and apple - its an awesome combination. We watched the Circle, and of course, GAME OF THRONES.

Also, I'm in love with this popcorn.

I had a great week- it was relaxing, I got some work done- and I'm excited to start at Galvanize!
