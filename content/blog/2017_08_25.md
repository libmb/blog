This is going to be a recap of the week- without anything from this coming weekend! It's shorter, for sure. With less outside and sunshine. But TOMORROW- we move! I want to get all of the details from this past week out first.

First, the BIGGEST update, is that Zac surprised me with TWO PAIRS of ALL BIRDS. I'm obsessed! I got the light gray wool loungers and the heather gray runners. IT'S THE MOST COMFORTABLE MY FEET HAVE EVER BEEN. Seriously, they make me happy all day long.

Second biggest update is that our barista express is the greatest addition to our house in awhile. We have our settings locked in, and every morning we brew amazing cups of expresso. I've been steaming almond milk and making lattes. It's just so great.

One night, we decided to make affogatos for dessert. **yum**

Monday was the eclipse. Tristan, a 46-er, brought in glasses for my entire cohort. THE BEST. We stopped class for a solid two hours so that everyone could go get a look. I went up to the patio for a few minutes, and then grabbed lunch at Postino's with a coworker. We sat on the patio, of course, so I still got to check it out! Plus, lunch was fantastic.

Tuesday I met Lena for Breakfast club. I worked on some calligraphy and we caught up on our weeks!

On Thursday I ran into Lena again, and she went for a walk with me so I could grab some fresh air! We went up to the highlands, to the one place I can get fountain sodas. Sometimes, I just crave one.

This week at work, I tried to get a lot of different things done. Met with students, contributed to galvanize instructional content, caught up on student submitted assessments and taught lessons on JS functions, loops, conditionals and built in js methods. Phew! I also set up an 'office' area. Let's be real, its a bench. But I love it.

Today, Friday, I wore my feminism shirt. Tomorrow is women's equality day- and it was a good way to open up conversation with students. They are SO receptive and inclusive- we have a great group.

I got into a really good routine this week- and hit the gym every morning. I'm HURTING, but I'm so happy.

Zac was home this week- which has been wonderful. I love spending evenings with him. When he works, he tends to doodle about shelters house. That also makes me happy.

Oh, two friends got married. They woke up at like 4am, climbed a mountain, and eloped. So, they are crazy awesome.
