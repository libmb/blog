It feels so great to be on break week. School just builds and builds until project week, and by the end- it's just exhausting. Having the week off is necessary.

Monday I spent some time outside. Rex and Leo went on an outing. In the afternoon, I wasn't ready to let go of the sun yet- so I sat up on the roof for a little while.

I sent out the decor for the shower. I'm bummed I'll miss it, but I know it will be wonderful.

Saturday morning I headed to Summer Soul Yoga with the girls. IT WAS AMAZING. I loved it SO MUCH and I can't wait to go again. The yoga was great- it's nice to be stronger. And the food. THE. FOOD.
