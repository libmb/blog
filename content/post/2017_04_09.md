I think that with school, and TAing JavaScript foundations every Tuesday and Thursday- the weeks are just flying by.

This week I had a lot of Greek Salads. Rather than making my own dressings from the TIU plan, I decided to just grab a bottle of healthy- clear ingredient- greek dressing. I had it practically every day- and it satisfied my craving!

On Thursday night, after TA, I spotted some 46ers at DBC. Z was at tennis, so I went home to get Rex and we walked on over to say Hi.

This weekend we got to relax. We headed to Ink on Saturday to grab some coffees. It's becoming a routine I love..

We relaxed on the rooftop for a while, but it was wayyy too warm up there. so we headed back down after awhile.

This weekend was Steph's Bachelorette! I was/am sad I missed out. I'm sure it was a great time.. I rocked my bride shirt all day to support the day from afar..

Sunday was RUNDAY. Rex and I started out with a couple miles.

Then we headed to Stapleton for Zac's tennis match. He's in a mixed double league and IM SO HAPPY HE'S PLAYING AGAIN.

Since we were in Stapleton, we stopped over at Stanley Marketplace. Zac hadn't been yet- and I wanted to grab a latte. Obviously. Problems. Or not. Passion.
