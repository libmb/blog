A short week! Monday we were off for Presidents day! Tuesday we started off covering test based assessments. Right now, we are using them for some of our assessments- but I look forward to Q2 when we learn how to write them! Now we have an updated flow/map of Q1:

We also spent some more time on Responsive CSS. I will say that by the end of this week, I feel much better about the topic and like flex box a lot more. I also really respect mobile first design.

Early this week I realized that I had some fierce competition on CodeWars. Its healthy, but is making me try harder katas and i'm trying to fit more in. One morning I worked on one for like three hours, and when I went to submit it I got a server error. No worries, I had it copied. It was funny.. (and I'm still losing)..

Wednesday we started JavaScript. I was super excited to switch it up and start another aspect of web dev. We covered the basics and did some assessments. During free time I headed upstairs to work from the 'club galvanize' area. Stevie was in the classroom outside and I just love him.

Wednesday after class, Galvanize had a guest speaker, the CTO at Rachio. I stayed to hear from him- about his company and the work they do (although, I have a friend who works there so I was already pretty familiar). It was really cool to see how involved their system is! If I had a yard I'd totally look into their product.

Thursday we learned DOM. I was not feeling well and it was really hard for me to process anything we learned. I took some medicine while on lunch and felt much better in the afternoon. I feel like I am getting better- but I still need to do some work to understand the basic concepts. I'll probably dedicate some time to that this weekend.

On my way to class Friday I stopped for a latte. Because friday. and latte.

Friday morning we had another guest speaker. This time it was Michael Dusing, a local UX Designer. He had a GREAT presentation about work, life and paths to success. I loved hearing from him, his slideshow was FANTASTIC and I can't wait to hear from more design people. He also brought stickers!

After we started another scrimmage day, while one-on-ones were going on. This week we worked on a pixel art creator. I got stuck a few places, and loved working with my table. I'm pretty happy with what I accomplished in one day- but have some stretch goals I want to work in.
