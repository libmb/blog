This weekend we MOVED. A whole hallway away from where we were before! When it came time to sign our lease again, I just didn't want to move. I was content- sure, our apartment was small- and it had a few negative aspects- but, moving === UGHHHH. Zac and I compromised on an apartment that was going to be available down the hall. Its a bit bigger, has better views and a better color scheme/layout.

As we approached moving day, I hmmm'd and hawww'd at how long it would take- all the packing and prepping. Zac assured me- we don't need to pack! It's so close. I thought he was SUPER wrong, but was willing to go with it and see how it went.

So- Saturday morning- we had a cup of coffee- in our fully unpacked normal day-to-day way. Then, at 8 we got our keys!

As soon as we walked into the new place, I was SO glad we were moving- the little extra space makes it feel so roomy- and the colors are AMAZING.

Saturday was the annual pool party at the complex- so we stopped by to grab food and say hi!

HOW did we move all our stuff? Friday night we went to Target and bought two big bins for $15. We would load them up in the old apartment, roll them to the new apartment, and unpack them! The big furniture was hard- but overall- a total win.

By Saturday night, we had 90% of our things moved over. Sunday we finished up- and cleaned 161 before saying goodbye!
