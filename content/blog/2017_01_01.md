It has been a crazy week, but it was full of family, friends and ended with the start of the New Year!

On Christmas Eve we drove up to Rochester to see my Aunt and cousins. My Aunt throws a "Chrismukkah" party, and her best friend brings her two adorable girls, her husband, and their parents. It was great to see them all again- to practice my lazy ASL and get an insight to RSL (The grandparents speak RSL and know hardly any ASL!). It was a lot of fun, it's always crazy to see how fast those kids grow!

Christmas day we spent with Zac's family (and OF COURSE, Cheered on the STEELERS!). It was a really great day, and it was such a wonderful time of year to catch up with everyone.

While we were in town we got to visit some new local places- a brewery, a cider mill and a coffee place (which we ended up at more than once). Everything we had was awesome, and I hope these local businesses are really successful this year!

We also stopped at Wegmans, so that I could get my fill of Wegmans-brand products. Call me crazy, but the White Shells Mac & Cheese is unlike any other brand. We actually got flagged going through airport security because I stuck 12 boxes in Zac's carry on....

Speaking of getting home- thankfully Zac is a seasoned flier now! We arrived at the airport and it was completely closed down for suspicious activity. Zac called the nearest airport, and got us out from there. Luckily we had great family members driving us all around!

We made it home late Thursday, and were greeted Friday by a BEAUTIFUL Denver Winter day. It was 60 degrees! So, after picking up Rex, we took a walk to Avanti's for lunch. We love it there. So much to choose from, and it all tastes so fresh.

To end the year, we ended up dog sitting for a dog friend. Leo was a sweet addition to the evening, and we spent some time cuddling.

I hope that you had a great holiday season! HAPPY 2017!
