Energy was pretty low this week, and I wasn't feeling fantastic some days- but it was a good week.

Monday night we rented Dr. Strange. IT WAS SO GOOD. It's actually probably one of my favorite movies now. I'll have to own it and watch it again and again... I HOPE there is another (&soon).

Tuesday was my **early day** so we hit the gym and took it easy.

Wednesday Zac and I grabbed lunch at Brider. It was delicious, and wonderful outside. Before leaving, we grabbed lattes to take back to work with us.

Wednesday night we grilled some dinner and sat by the fire for a bit. It's so nice to be outside.

Thursday we had a long standing plan to meet up with some friends at Blake Street Vault. I was excited for Zac to try the fried cheese and HE DOESNT EVEN LIKE IT. I think he's insane, and its by far the best. I guess more for me?

Friday we rented another movie- Arrival. It was REALLY good. Much better than I expected...

On Sunday, I did some meal prep- and that pretty much covered out week. Lot's of relaxing and catching up on things.
