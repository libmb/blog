I didn't take my pictures this week at Galvanize. Must have been too busy learning or something----

We dived into even more topics this week! Including DATABASES, psql, ddl/ddm, and server side applications.

This week was all about the breakouts. Attending smaller size classes, for shorter periods, on concentrated topics. It had a few hitches, but wasn't the worst.

Monday morning we had a guest speaker- Teagan. A BA developer at massroots- who has automated her entire home. I looked forward to meeting her, and wasn't let down. She's really authentic and in that, inspiring.

At lunch we started something REALLY exciting. A group of us pitched in to buy Pandemic Legacy. Mondays at lunch we'll be playing. This week, WE WON JANUARY.

Tuesday morning I, once again, grabbed a photo from the fourth floor balcony.

It was a pretty nice week. Zac and Rex walked me to school in the mornings.

And we got a bunch of work done outside.

Rex had a half day stretch at Galvanize, but didn't get enough morning exercise to last a whole day.

End of the week, our scrimmage was a [reddit clone.](https://intense-inlet-58162.herokuapp.com/) I decided to go with a hike theme. It was a lot of fun to put together.

Only one more week until projects? REALLY?
