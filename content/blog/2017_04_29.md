WOW. Let's talk about a fast week. A hectic, crazy, week! Group projects are great, and in some ways hard! That being said, WE MADE IT.

We started off our week by reviewing our pencil work. We established our project, our ERD, the wireframes and user stories. We combined all our ideas- and made sure that each of us had the same understanding of MVP and stretch goals.

From there- this whole week was this:

- Group Stand up (review yesterdays work, establish daily MVP, make a plan)
- Pair program until Lunch
- git push, merge, and deploy
- Regroup after Lunch
- Pair program until 4
- git push, merge and deploy
- Acceptance with our product owner
- Group stand down

We were really ambitious in our project- and didn't get exactly where we wanted. That being said- we hit some really tough pain points- and worked through them as a team.

I didn't really see many other people this week! I still came in on Tuesday, and Lena and I caught up. It's becoming a therapeutic routine.

Rex joined us one afternoon- He got a bone from the pet store across the street- and just relaxed.

Thursday was the last day of coding for the project. I grabbed a latte at lunch, and took the best group picture ever:

Friday we PRESENTED FIRST!, enjoyed the other presentations, did a group retro and stand down and THAT IS IT. PROJECT WEEK WAS OVER. At lunch, practically all of us headed over to DBC for burger food truck- and beers for everyone else.

Lena suggested we grab a glass of wine after class- to save money we just grabbed wine at the liquor store and had a drink on the balcony! She really is a dose of sanity.

And guys, that is it. WE'RE HALFWAY DONE. It's crazy.
