After a long weekend of moving, I was super sore this week- and the week itself was a bit of a rollercoaster.

Monday- Lena got a jobbbbbb! So we went to DBAR to celebrate with dessert.

Tuesday was not so great. Galvanize is restructuring and 37 employees were let go. It was hard. After work I grabbed a drink with a co-worker to chat about the situation.

On Saturday I won a raffle at the party- and gave my mug to Justine. When I got home on Tuesday, there was flowers on my patio saying thanks (for a free mug)! She's the sweetest.

Friday morning James was our guest speaker in 64! He gave his Develop Denver talk and it was awesome.

After work, a bunch of Galvanizers were going out for a drink so Zac and I joined them at Terminal Bar! (first and second visit in the same week). It was fun, and of course, I got spoken to by security.

Saturday morning we woke up and headed to Ikea! We have space for a TABLEEEEEE. To eat at! I'm thrilled. I've wanted a table for about ever. I feel like it gives me an opportunity to 1. eat civilly and 2. host people for eating! We bought one of the cheapest tables they have- because things in our life will surely change- that being said- it's perfffecccct. A huge thank you to my husband for caving and going with a 4 person table when he really wanted a 2 person table because his wife NEEDED the 4 person table.

We also picked up a small table for the patio so we can work outside.

The smoke this weekend was awful. I really hope all the fires clear up soon. With the smoke, the city is clouded- but it did make for a pretty sunset Saturday night.

Sunday Kerry came over and we headed to the container store, for CONTAINERSSS, and REI to look at tents.

We stayed in for dinner and I made soup for our hike the next morning! On Monday, we woke up bright and early to head to Mt. Evans to hike a 14er!

It was a beautiful day! Unfortunately, a while in, Zac had to turn back. He was getting altitude sickness- and so he decided to head back to the parking lot and meet us at the top (a road actually goes to the top of this particular mountain). Reluctantly I let him go, and carried on with Kerry. Rex climbed rocks like a beast.

We made it to the top, and immediately, I was hit with altitude sickness. I can't even explain the switch that happened. I was totally fine- high energy, happy, excited. And then I was dead. I was hot- and stripped off my layers while it was snowing. I laid down on rocks and my vision went black. I was nauseous and couldn't think straight. IT WAS CRAZY. So, perhaps, that was my first and last 14er.

Hitting the top and meeting up with Zac was not the end of the day.
On our way down the mountain, flat tire.
On summit road.
In the middle of no-where.

AAA said it would be about 4 hours until they could come.
It was the last day the road was open for the season.
Strangers tried to help but couldn't.
Finally- our knight in shining armor- the forest patrol- saved us.

To be honest, with how I was feeling, I was practically useless. I sat with Rex and watched the story unfold. Zac and Kerry were rockstars.

About 2 hours later, we had our donut on, and we were headed down the mountain. What. A. Day. Great stories.

When we got home, we went to machete for dinner, and grabbed icecream at the milkbox.

Next week could be a little less exciting. I'd be ok with that!
