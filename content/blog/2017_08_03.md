It has been a CRAZY THREE MONTHS.
WHY, OH WHY haven't I kept up with this?

Probably a mixture of things. First I was changing photo storage and that totally threw off my groove.

Then, school got intense, and I was saying yes to as many great amazing things as possible.

Something suffered, and it was this blog. But, I miss it. I wish I had kept up with it, and so- here we go again!

I did a lot the last three months, let's see how I can recap it.

School was awesome. I'M DONE, BTW. I completed two more quarters, presented my capstone & graduated!

Outside of school, volunteering and general code stuff- I had a LOT of fun. Fun with Zac, girls nights, and my first trip to Tracks! We saw OAR & Train at Fiddler's Green on the 4th of July. Also caught Summer Soul yoga!

We went on some awesome hikes- and I think that this summer will lead to even more breath-taking moments! We made it to Mt. Sanitas, St. Mary's Glacier, Chief Mountain, and Garden of the Gods.

I read three books. Two were thrillers/mysteries. I'm currently reading another- which is SO weird, and not my typical style. BUT I LOVED THESE. [not pictured: Longbourn by Jo Baker]

STEPH & GEOFF GOT MARRIED. AND IT WAS THE BEST.
We had a great trip to NY- Saw the family, and had a WONDERFUL time. Amber even made a quick trip out for a Buffalo breakfast!

And all of this wonderful-ness leads me to today. Thursday of my week off. That's right- I start my next job on MONDAY! To celebrate, I bought new towels. They are amazing.
