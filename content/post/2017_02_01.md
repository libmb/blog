Friday night we went out for Thai! As usual, Zac ordered the better dish. Mine was a little (way) too spicy for my likes, so I helped Z out a bit. It was good, but we'll still be on the hunt for Denvers best Thai!

Saturday night we went out for a few drinks. We wanted to stay close, since Zac was still recovering. We headed to Zengo, but they had a huge Year of the Rooster celebration going on, and we weren't able to get in the door! So we went next door to McLoughlins. It was probably for the better. They were playing great 90s music and had the X Games on!

The Australian Open was on at 1 am, so we (Zac) were determined to stay up for it! Rafa and Fed? It was sure to be a great match, and from what I've heard, it was! I fell asleep as soon as it started. Couldn't stay up another minute! Zac was a champ and watched the whole thing.

Sunday Zac was super tired from his late night so we pretty much just hung out and watched The Man at the High Castle. I went to the gym, of course. The workouts are still great, and this week they're amping them up a little. It's great timing.

I made omelettes for breakfast with the veggies I had left over from the week. We also tried the Ginger Sesame Chicken from TIU and it was fantastic.

Monday I took Rex on some errands. During the weeks while Zac is gone I try to take Rex everywhere. It helps keep his energy down! Monday I rewarded him with a quick stop at Krisers.

My Amazon order came in Monday afternoon. Two more of the BEST sports bras, and a new container of ACV. I spent the afternoon meal prepping. I made Almond Butter cookies for the cookie smoothie on the plan this week. Its delicious! I also made some Cinnamon Energy Bites to take to craft night.

Before leaving for the evening, I took Rex for a nice long walk. We got some really good views of the sunset. I do wish I could grab a photo that does the mountains justice.

Monday I grabbed a lyft to Cojos for Craft Night! I missed the last few months due to holiday travel, and I'm so excited I finally made it. Ladies, wine, food, crafts. What else could you want in an evening? I even managed to organize someones prismacolor pencils. Because, personality.

ALSO BTW. Lyft/Uber rides are my favorite thing since moving to Denver. Really. Someday I'll give a little rave for them.

Yesterday, I cleaned up and took a bunch of photos for my next blog post. I also caught up on The Vampire Diaries. Zac's sister, Mel, and I are the hugest TVD Fans. This week when NINA posted that she'd be coming back- we pretty much freaked out. I AM SO EXCITED.
