Monday was my first day as a Resident Instructor at Galvanize! It was a lot of meetings and getting access set up. I went to lunch with Brooks, the Lead Instructor for 64. We walked up to Uber Eats and I grabbed the highland salad. It was FANTASTIC.

Tuesday I was invited to lunch, and decided to go. I'm going to have to work on my ability to NOT go, but everyone was going and I figured it would be a good way to settle into the new role. We went to Avanti and I tried my first Arepas. So good.

The second day I had a meeting with my instructional coach. He led me through the instructors curriculum and it was a really great conversation. I'm going to learn so much in this role.

It was a pretty short and sweet first week- because Thursday and Friday Galvanized was essentially closed down for the local conference, Develop Denver. It was SO MUCH fun. I met up with a lot of 46-ers and people I know from the local tech community. The talks were great, and I can't wait to go again next year! (Hopefully I'll get involved with some planning too).

Saturday morning we headed off on a family hike to Flora Mountain. It was GORGEOUS. It was actually pretty hard with the elevation, but we made it without hesitation. I would definitely recommend this one.

After hiking, we went up to the highlands for dinner. We stopped at Stones (we thought it was a wood-fired pizza place). They didn't really have anything on the menu that we were interested in- so we had a drink and went up to Lohi Steakbar. It was a great place. Loved the outdoor atmosphere. However, the best Denver steak award still goes to Guard and Grace.

Sunday Zac had a tennis match. When we got to the courts, it started raining! However, literally a block away, it wasn't. So the match relocated to another club and it was a great day to sit outside and enjoy a match.

The rest of Sunday was as-usual. Relaxing, laundry, food, and GOT.

Can't wait to meet the students!
