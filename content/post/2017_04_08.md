Week two of Mod 2 definitely picked up speed. After spending last week reviewing Q1, this week we dived into some new concepts- all gearing up for backend. We started: ES6, Express & Body parser.

Monday and Tuesday it was pretty cold. I really don't mind being stuck in the basement when it's snowy outside!

To start the week off on the right foot, I brought in CUPCAKES. Vanilla cupcakes with peanut buttercream frosting. NOMMS.

Monday we had a guest speaker- [blinker](https://www.blinker.com/). The speaker answered a lot of great questions. Since I got in a few minutes late, I ended up sitting in the back, petting Molly, the whole time.

Tuesday we just got covered in snow. It was early day- so I went up the the fourth floor first to grab some untouched snow pictures! It's really beautiful. And easier to appreciate when you know it won't last.

Tuesday after foundations we started streaming George. He's going to start using Twitch to show off some skills with CSS. I'm excited to catch a full video sometime, I feel like I could learn a lot from him.

Thursday we had another gWomen lunch! We started white boarding, which is such a great exercise. I'm glad to be starting now.

Friday it was finally starting to really warm up again. A bunch of us got some work down on the balcony- and hung around after for some Tacos!
