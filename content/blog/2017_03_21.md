Time to recap the life portion of the school life balance from last week!

Monday at the gym ALL OF THE DUMBBELLS WERE THERE. I have never seen this before. People suck at picking up after themselves...

Tuesday night we grilled on the roof. We were hoping to catch some Tennis up there on the TV- but apparently our complex has different subscriptions in different rooms.. So after, we ended up back in the apartment subscribing to tennis channel....

This week I have a cautionary tale for meal prepping... I tend to use the same meals throughout the week. It makes shopping, prepping and cooking easier. But this week, I felt AWFUL after eating lunch on Monday. Due to food or not, I just couldn't bring myself to eat the food I had prepped. Ugh- what a waste. I learned a lesson, and when I meal plan this week for Quarter two, I'll be incorporating some variety through the week.

So- food was basic- and I found a new combination I LOVE. My favorite Wegmans Granola and Coconut Noosa. Noosa is becoming my FAVORITE, slowly taking over my Chobani flip obsession.

My new Micron pens came in this week! I can't wait to start playing with them and some typography books. You know, when I have a second of free time again lol.

It has been so great to have Zac home. We're getting totally spoiled.

Thursday was REALLY exciting. First, my project in school was done- but after school we had a dinner and movie date!

We decided to go to a well known restaurant in downtown called Guard and Grace. It was wonderful. Everything was so good. I got a glass of red wine, a house salad and a 4 oz filet. If you want a steak in Denver, I highly recommend!

I totally bought tickets to Beauty and the Beast a month before it came out! IT WAS SO GOOD! AHHH! I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT AGAIN. I'll be preordering that one....

Friday was the official start to break. I got home around 3:30- and sat in the sun, started my new Shades of Magic book and started relaxing!

We cooked up on the roof again- enjoyed dinner in sun.

About 4 hours later I had Atom open starting a new project, because, who takes a real break?

Saturday morning I made bacon and apple omelettes. I LOVE putting apples in with the bacon. Seriously, it's a great combination.

Then we went to Aurora for a bike sale. Didn't find anything we needed, and so we headed to Cherry Creek so Zac could order his tux for the upcoming wedding.

After we got back, Zac went on a bike ride ( I NEED TO GET MY SHIT TOGETHER AND GO! - **clip in pedal problems** ). I got some snaps from my cohort that there was a housewarming party about .5 miles away from where I live- so I popped over to say hi and meet some people. Hot Dudes Reading was on the table- FTW.

Saturday we decided to go for an easy hike. We have some goals this year- and should start training easy. We headed up to [Glendale](http://dayhikesneardenver.com/glendale-farm-trail-douglas-county-open-space/) to do a quick loop. After, we went into the off leash area and let Rex trot around.

When we got home, I made Coffee Smoothies. I didn't measure, but it was something like this:
- .5 Cup Almond Milk
- 1.5 Cup Coffee
- 2T Peanut Butter
- 2 Scoops Vanilla Protein
- 1T coffee grounds

They were really good. Will be making more in the future, and playing with the ingredients!

We grilled dinner, again, of course, 'TIS THE SEASON!
