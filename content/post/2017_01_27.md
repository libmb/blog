Last week Rex and I had some movie dates. We watched The Secret Life of Pets (adorable) and The Legend of Tarzan (amazing). I even let him on the couch, because I. Am. Weak.

We had a few beautiful days, so we went on long walks in the highlands and lodo.

Zac got home last Thursday night, and he has been sick with an awful cold since.

Then, this weekend, Rex got some form of conjunctivitis. So, with a ton of medicine and as much patience as possible, I have been caring for them.

My Rogue order came in on Friday! It has been so helpful! The sklz slidez are great- I kept falling off my other ones. These have grooves which allow greater movement without losing your place! The ab mat is fantastic, and I grabbed the shirt for Zac (it fits with his general philosophy and when I saw it I couldn't pass it ups).

Over the weekend, I made moroccan stew. It's not my favorite dish, but I'm also not use to sweet tasting soups. I LOVED Chia seed pudding. A great way to satisfy a sweet tooth.

Lately, I have had an addiction to Lattes. Seriously, I'm obsessed. I don't even like the taste of coffee any more- I am totally ruined. We have two great places within walking distance: Ink & Carbon. At Ink, I love the white almond latte. At Carbon, I always switch it up. They make their own syrups, and I always love what I get. This week I grabbed a lemon verbena and it was amazing. I've been researching options for making them at home... but no clear solution yet. *sighs.*

Sunday, was football day. UGH. What an anxiety filled game. Rex settled his head right on our legs, probably trying to ground us. It was a night full of cuss words and "Oh Man" texts to my brother. I went to bed totally heartbroken. I still love my team, and I look forward to seeing them next season.

Getting up early has been harder this week... but when I manage to get myself up and moving, I am greeted by a wonderful sky.

This weekend will probably be low-key, but next week Zac will be in LA, and I have some fun things planned to pass the time. Two weeks until school!
