This week Zac was in St. Louis again. Rex and I got in lots of exercise and a little relaxation. We got up a couple mornings and went for a run before the day. This keeps him tired when I'm away, or when I bring him in with me.

Monday night I rented Moana! It was adorable. I love Disney.

Tuesday night Rex came to Foundations with me. He was pretty good- and we had a really nice walk home afterwards. It's so pretty here, all the time.

It's getting light out earlier, and the sunrise commutes have been gorgeous.

Saturday, Zac and I took the car in to switch out the tires! No more winter tires needed. It took about an hour, so we walked to a Brewery, [Briar Common,](http://www.briarcommon.com/) and chatted. We ended up talking about assembly language. HE IS SO SMART. I understand that he has far more education in the field, and more experience, but I hope to just soak it up and get there someday!

Sunday morning I had a haircut at Stanley Marketplace. Next cut, I'm getting a color too. I'm pretty excited to have hair again. ITS SO LONG. [(#bravetheshave)](https://www.stbaldricks.org)

Then we went out for a quick hike. I really wanted Rex to get some energy out before Zac left for work again. I knew the next week would be crazy with projects.

We went to [South Valley Park Trails](http://dayhikesneardenver.com/south-valley-park-ken-caryl/) and did about 2 miles. It was a really nice day.

One more week until BREAK WEEK!
