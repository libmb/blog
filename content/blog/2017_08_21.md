Monday was the first day of students in 64! It was SO GREAT meeting 25 new faces. It'll take a few days to remember names, but the name game never fails to help.

This week I taught a couple lessons: Intro to CSS, Flexbox, Git/Github and some micro lessons on atom shortcuts and collaborating on Github. It was great, and stressful, but great. I'm learning so much- and really enjoying interacting with this new crew!

A new Galvanize commercial came out this week, and it featured a lot of familiar faces! Won't lie- I can't stop watching it.

Monday night I met Kathy for happy hour. We met at Public School 303 and chatted for hours. Wine, french fries & good company. She's fantastic, I can't wait to meet up again.

Wednesday morning I realized I hadn't had coffee all week- and I had been coming home with awful headaches. I decided to start the morning RIGHT with a trip to Carbon. The monthly flavor- Pistachio- was to die for.

Wednesday night I went to orientation for GDI Event Organizers. I am PSYCHED to be joining the group in a formal way, and I'm so excited to plan some events. It's such a small world- I also loved seeing all the ladies I typically run into in the tech scene here.

I took home the leftover wine (I walk-) and watched some Seeker of Truth.

Thursday we held class at the GT Campus. It was interesting to spend a day there- and it was member appreciation day. We all benefitted with free drinks and BBQ.

Friday morning I grabbed fancy-coffee-friday upstairs, and then started the end of the first week with guest speakers!

It was a crazy first week. During it all- Rex was a champ with my busy schedule, and we fit in some dog park trips and walks.

Which leads me to the FUNNEST most JAM PACKED Weekend I've had in a while! Friday night we were both pretty tired, so we relaxed. Which was a good thing- because little did we know it would be the only chance!

Saturday morning we headed to the Union Station Market. We've been craving some Bourbon Peppercorn Goat Cheese. So. We also picked up some other goods. It's adorable, and small, and close, and I love it.

After the Market, we headed to the pool for about an hour.

My new book came in, so I got to start RE-READING the best series ever. Cojo is also reading- and we're the two official members of the #swordoftruthbookclub.

Then, we did something REALLLLY exciting. We bought the Barista Express. We've been talking about an espresso machine for years. Lately, we've been talking about it a lot more. After lots of research, Zac found the best option for us currently.. I'm SO excited to learn all the things, and drink amazing lattes all the time.

We didn't get to try the machine Saturday because Kerry got free tickets to the Rapids game! The poooooor team. They lost 0-1, and they SCORED AGAINST THEMSELVES. It was still awesome. The weather COULD NOT have been better.

Sunday morning, we woke up super early and headed to Boulder to hike Royal Arch! It was rated hard- and that's fair. It was only 3 miles but it was really steep. We had a great time- and afterwards we stopped in Boulder to walk the mall and show Kerry around.

I drove home, and everyone else fell asleep. Typical.

When we got home, we had salads and headed to the pool. At 2, Kerry and I went to get our nails done- Zac had a tennis match (seriously can't imagine playing tennis after that hike). After nails, we headed to the mall so Kerry could grab an outfit for an upcoming wedding! After, we were overdue for dinner. We grabbed some ZA at Proto's.

Then, it was time for Game of Thrones. Let's be honest, it's just too early to talk about that. OY THINGS ARE CRAZY!
