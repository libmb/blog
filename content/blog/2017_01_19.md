It takes 21 days to make a habit, and I'm on day 19 of Tone It Up! That's 2 days from a habit? AND 2 days since "Ditch Day". This week I'm feeling great again. Last week I had some ups and downs-

First, helpful tool of the week: CARDIO PLAYLIST ON SPOTIFY.
Seriously love this list so much. After I finished my last audiobook, I couldn't get into the next one I picked. I was only a few days away from a new Audible credit, so I decided to wait it out and listen to some music (& catch some TV like NFL GAME DAY and a movie here or there). I have my new credit, and love my new book- but I only listen to it during cardio. Ironically, the rest of the time, I'm moving to the Cardio Playlist! If you're into high octane music, give it a try.

What I learned last week is that I NEED TO EAT. I was so busy- I was jumping from one thing to the next and not prioritizing all 5 meals. So, I'd skip one, or two, in a day. I wouldn't feel hungry, until bed time. At that point, I knew I didn't want to eat anything. I'm trying REALLY hard not to eat anything after 7pm. So, I went to bed hungry. This was a HUGE MISTAKE. With the workouts, cardio and yoga I've been doing- I need food! Power! Energy! (Also, everyone needs food, and you should never go to bed hungry). I ended up crashing last week- and took some long naps. Then I started keeping up with meals. Even if I had to combine a M2 and M3, or a M4 and M5. I ate all the food in the plan. And you know what- I didn't go to bed hungry, and I have so much energy. So, EAT! It's part of taking care of yourself.

Eating aside, I also somehow hurt my leg this past weekend. Just a strained muscle- but I didn't want to move it into an injury- so while I've kept up on all workouts, I have been going just a little bit easier on my cardio (little less resistance, a few less strides/minute). It already feels better and I think I'll kick cardio back up a notch in a day or two.

As for workouts, I never purchased the workout videos from Tone It Up. Instead, I've been creating my own circuits. The ability to create these, well, I give all of the credit to Crossfit! Oh- a 22 minute video doing legs and shoulders? I'll throw together an EMOM. Or a METCON. Or, my absolute fav, Fight Gone Bad Style. Today there was an Arms and Abs video I don't have- so I threw together this FGB style workout: crunches, plank, sit ups, push ups, arm circles, break, dumbbell side bend, med ball chopper, farm carry, balance point crunches, break. The flow feels really productive- and you can do anything for 1 minute!

Speaking of Crossfit- I do miss it. I miss it most on days when the plan calls for something like deadlifts, and I'm like- where my Olympic Weights at? Haha. I can only do so much with 12 lb dumbbells...

I took a little time off from Yoga this week- due to my leg, but I did make one great class on a sunny morning.

Tonight, Zac gets home- and he's off travel next week. I'll be happy to have my work out partner back!

Midway through week 4, I love the plan. My water intake is 100% and my eating is great. I'm feeling pretty good.
