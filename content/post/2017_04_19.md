Wednesday night I went to my second hackathon! This one was hosted by name.com. The premise was we were given a domain name (cloud.denver) and two hours to make the best website for that domain. A lot of people showed up- and the place was packed! We ended up with a team that was wayy too big for a two hour hackathon- 10 people.

Our team name was DARE (given to us by the host). We got started by brainstorming ideas- and narrowing it down to our favorite: Platform as an Unreliable Service (going for humor here).

From there, things got pretty crazy, pretty quick. We had too many bodies- with not enough to do, AND we went with a technology that only two team members were familiar with (angular). SO. It was an experience. I learned A LOT and will definitely take that into the next hackathon that I particpate in.

In the end, it was fun. Our project was- ahhem- not the best. But we worked as a team and got something presentable. Watching the presentations was a blast- and we had a HUGE 46 turn out. In the end, I'm excited for the next hackathon challenge!
