Tuesday I felt so sick. Leftover altitude sickness. I went into work, and really didn't realize how disoriented I was until Wednesday when I looked at some things I had typed up the day before. Tuesday night I went to the event organizers meeting for GDI. We planned out the quarter, and Cojo gave me a ride home (because concerned). Her and Keith are the best.

Monday night I slept 11 hours. Tuesday night I slept 10 hours. I woke up on Wednesday feeling better- refreshed, a clear mind.

Wednesday night, I went to a Rockies game with Zac and some people at his work. It was a great night, I had a blast, and I love the people he works with and their families.

It was great having Zac home this week. He got to partake in my morning coffee rituals.

Thursday was AGILE day at Galvanize for 64. I love the agile game- this group killed it.

Friday morning, my walk into work was beautiful- made even better by Zac and Rex joining me.

I had a blast, I love that game- and Zac got super into it too.

I'm cutting this recap here- because tomorrow, RICK AND CATH COME! That will be a post all it's own.

Oh, new mug love:
