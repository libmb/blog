![Two boxes of Donuts!](/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/m.donut.jpg)

Monday morning two classmates pulled together to bring in a BUNCH of doughnuts! They are for sure not on the plan- but I had one and it literally made me happy- so there's that. (ps. they were awesome for doing that).

![Guest Speaker](/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/m.guest.jpg)

We started off the week with a guest speaker- a UX designer! It was a really interesting talk- and I appreciate seeing and hearing from different people in the tech field- who work in the various aspects of web development.

Topic wise- we covered models and deployed to Firebase. It was a gentle way to start the week! (And I think Kiki is warming up to me!)

On Tuesdays, I get in early to do some side work with a classmate- we kind of review the things we've gone over and talk about anything we're stuck on. I was first in the basement, so I made all the fresh coffee.

I also decided to take over our white boards. They were getting pretty messy and hard to read- so I decided to clean them up a bit and bring a little inspiration to the walls!

Since I go in early, I have a really hard time eating breakfast before hand. I pretty much just suck at getting up in the morning. Luckily- I know myself and meal prep! SO I brought breakfast and enjoyed it in the classroom. (Overnight oats for the win).

Topic wise, we covered wireframes and closures

I was feeling AWFUL on Tuesday. I actually contemplated leaving the entire day,  but my pain subsided after lunch and I pulled it off. Since I was feeling crappy- and wear my emotions on my sleeve- Jordan gave me his origami for the day.

He makes these everyday! Out of bus passes and random papers. They are AMAZING. I love them and wish I could make these things without looking them up..

Wednesday Izabella brought Ziggy to class! He was super sweet.

It was INTERNATIONAL WOMENS DAY and during stand up George gave a really, really nice little speech about it. (And I was really glad that I wasn't the first to mention it during interestings!) Anyway, there were a lot of events going on that night- but I couldn't make any of them.

![IWD Event](/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/w.iwd.jpg)

I finally completed a KATA submission on Wednesday, but it won't load. I'm guessing that I'm missing something-  but i'll have to come back to that later.

Thursday was BEAUTIFUL. I spent my free time outside. For lunch, Zac met me a Briders. They have a baby kale and apple salad he's been raving about- so I had to try it so that we can make it at home! (it was actually fantastic).

![Zac at Lunch](/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/r.lunch.jpg)

During lecture, we discussed agile workflows and user stories. I was super excited to move into this discussion - because it's such an important aspect of work at Pivotal and I had heard so much about it. Plus, we got to use Pivotal Tracker for logging user stories- it was a cool intersection of Zac's life and my schooling!

![Agile](/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/r.agile.png)

All afternoon, we working on assessments and brainstormed projects on the balcony. As mentioned, it was BEAUTIFUL!

Friday was PROPOSAL DAY. Oh gosh- FOUR WEEKS DONE? When did that happen.... Week five is all about our personal project- so on Friday we wrote up proposals- submitting them for review and made revisions as needed. Mine ended up getting approved a couple hours before the end of the day- but I'll save that for next week. What was REALLY exciting about Friday was that IT WAS REXY'S FIRST DAY AT GALVANIZE. Here he is being good boy at stand up:

![Rex](/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/f.rexstand.jpg)

We had a guest speaker- and he was pretty vocal during that (opps). He just wanted some water...

![Rex during speaker](/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/f.rexspeaker.jpg)

After that, we ironically did a agile exercise and it included a lot of tennis balls. Rex was super good though. And the exercise was awesome.

![Tennis](/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/f.tennis.jpg)

He pretty much just slept (because let's be honest, I took him for a run before we went in).

![Sleeping rex](/images/2017_03/2017_03_11/f.rexsleep.jpg)

We met Zac for lunch, and Rex went home with him after that- so that I could focus on some work.

So- that was week Four. A relatively easy going week to lead into projects. A great step with Rex. Lots of sun and fun. Here's our updated Q1 learn map!:
