As far as weeks go, this one was BUSY! Packed full of fun stuff.

Tuesday we signed up for a free bike class at REI. As for a free class, it was a good reminder. It's been a while since we've fixed a flat- and I think it as just what we needed there.

We also brought our dividend and grabbed a few things for hiking this year. We're going to try and be responsible by stocking up on those '10 things every hiker should have'. You know, just in case.

TUESDAY WAS ALSO REXYS BIRTHDAY! HE IS NOW A SENIOR DOG. Haha, he's seven. I made him a dog cupcake, and he devoured it.

Wednesday we had the GRILLED CHEESE FESTIVAL. I was so looking forward to this. It was in support of Imagination Library- which I was involved in back in NY. It was a night of unlimited drinks, grilled cheese and misc vendors. It was a great cause, but they lacked the planning required for such a large scale event. That being said- we enjoyed some great grilled cheese, supported a good cause, and then stopped at a bar on the way home for some food.

Thursday I missed JavaScript Foundations to attend Capstones. G38 was graduating, and I wanted to go see the presentations. We'll be the next class to graduate form Platte! Thats crazy. -Anyway, the presentations were really good.

Friday after work Zac and I met at DBC. I tried Princess Yum Yum, and it was ok. (beer hater)

Saturday we headed to the Fitzgeralds to celebrate Joe's citizenship! It was an adorable party- themed to the nines with all things American. I love that family- they're so great, and I loved meeting their friends. It was a great night. The next day, I realized I cannot drink that much anymore, but, it was fun.

As we were walking around their house, we spotted a cute picture of Amy's Place in Buffalo, NY. They actually had no clue what it was. Now, they know that it serves up some awesome breakfast.

Sunday we went for a nice walk- and grabbed coffee in the highlands.

I got some reading done outside, but Rex was too warm to hang.
