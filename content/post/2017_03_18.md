Wow, what a week! It seriously FLEW by. First, I'll review some pictures from the week, then get into the nitty gritty of projects....

After the weekend, I decided that Monday was the best day to bring Rex into class. It works for our schedule, and fits better with the general flow at school. He only stayed a half day- because, projects. Also, HE SHAMED THE FAMILY by deciding to mark a classmates bag. UGH REX WTH, MAN! The guy was super generous and I still feel awful.

Monday morning we had a guest speaker- Dish Network! I only went because I was assured that I could sit in the back and do work - that it wouldn't be rude. I guess this is a good time to say that I did NOTHING special or extra this week. I didn't attend any meet ups or go to breakout sessions. It was a busy week, and I prioritized what I thought was best for me.

Pretty much all week I worked upstairs, getting sun and fresh air.

OK, BEFORE I jump into Friday, I'll cover the project.

Quarter one projects are the embodiment of what we've learned this quarter. I submitted two ideas last Friday, and was directed to a certain one. What did I work on all week? GX!: Gifting Experiences. I decided to make something that was important to me, and perhaps would make life a little easier. I am really passionate about gifting experiences rather than material items- and in the past few years have gained some insight and experience in doing so. My idea was to create a web app that would allow a user to sort through gifts and return ones that fit with their scenario.

The requirements included: valid HTML, CSS, JavaScript and CSS Framework. Connect to at least one external API, and deploy to a production environment.

So, it took me all week. I used two API's (for weather and location) and by Wednesday night, I had a MVP (minimal viable product). Thursday I cleaned it up- and Friday, presented! Being honest, it could use some work and in the future, I'd like to do things differently (for instance, NOT use a CSS framework- but design the site myself).

Top things I learned?: 1. Local storage! Whoop. 2. When generating ideas- consider how much of the outcome relies on your creating content. The main product of the web app I created was written rather than pulled. I could spend hours and hours updating that content to make it better; and the product is that content! In the future, I will highly consider that.

Friday was presentation day. We submitted our projects (Github, deployed and wireframes)- and spent about 2-3 minutes demo-ing our product. I was BLOWN AWAY by my awesome cohort. Like, way to go guys. After, we were released for lunch and to create a YouTube video tutorial. About an hour before we were due back for retro- we were all finished and a bunch of us sat outside at DBC across the street.

Then we did Retro.. and PROJECT WEEK WAS COMPLETE.

That means that I AM ON BREAK. One week. I **plan** on getting a lot done- we'll see!
