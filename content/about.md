My name is Michelle. Perhaps obviously, many call me SHELTER.

My blog is just mine. I call it lifestyle, because it has no agenda. I post about what I did this week.
Who I saw, what I ate, the TV I watched. I talk about my goals, and my never ending attempts at learning new things.
I'll post about Denver, HOW MUCH I LOVE IT, and the awesome, beautiful places we visit here. I'll obsess over my dog, my husband, and lattes. Probably also the stickers I try to collect for my Mac Book Pro. I'll tell you all about how I'm trying to get into the tech field, and
become a successful developer. I'll talk about my undying love for libraries and reading. Probably post about my attempts at organization. I'll advocate for things I believe in. Because it's mine, and this is, *my house*.

I hope you enjoy.
