I am still feeling so incredibly spoiled for having Zac home. I know that he'll be starting another project soon and be back to traveling, but I am loving having him home!

Monday I finally did something I have been thinking about for a while. I deactivated Facebook. Seriously, I have wanted to get it out of my life for awhile. I was spending too much time doing nothing on there- and actually just hated it. I thought it was hilarious that once I decided to deactivate, it takes you through multiple options of PLEASE DON'T. But there was no turning back.

Thursday and Friday Rex went to Galvanize with me, which was great but also meant that I was trying to get some dog exercise in before hand every morning!

I got in some really good gym sessions this week. I am still loving everything about Tone It Up and I'm looking forward to the bikini series.

On Friday I watched most of the mens tennis match on the elliptical. It was an INSANE match. I'm so glad Fed won!

Saturday Zac and I went to the Galvanize/Pivotal gym to do some Rowing. It was active recovery day for me- So it was a good day to work in something we don't usually get to do. We did a 5-4-3-2-1 partner row for a total of 3000! We made pretty good time.

Then we played some ping pong. I need some practice to keep up.

In the afternoon, we headed to Public School 303. They have a GREAT happy hour (1/2 liter of wine). We grabbed a few apps and chatted for awhile. It is really cool that we can talk about tech in a new way now. Things I would not have understood, at all, just months ago we can now talk about at length.

And Saturday night we made some popcorn and watched a movie. I love honey powder with popcorn SO MUCH. There is a local store down the road that sells a ton of spices, and this one is a winner. Saturday night, I was literally asleep by 9:30. **win**

Another week down.. and up next is another week with Zac home!
