At the end of project week, I was feeling pretty good (energy wise). I fully expected myself to be spending my break days coding and learning! As it turns out, I had no idea how badly I needed a break until I had it. I started a few projects here and there, and worked on a few things. But mostly, I did laundry and errands-

On Monday, I started working on an Atom Package. Zac was a huge help- I don't have much experience with classes yet, so there was a learning curve that he helped me through. It's still a work in progress, but a really cool project to work on.

Monday Zac went to Wash Park to do some tennis drills. Rex and I went down and walked the park while he played.

Tuesday my new phone case came in! I ordered the same exact one I've had. After a few drops, my phone is still in perfect condition, but the case was compromsied. I feel better having a sturdy one again!

Tuesday night I was TAing for an intro to JavaScript class and stopped by the fundamentals class to say Hi! James has been with that class since the start, and was helping out with a few homework problems before class. I think that Galvanize needs to tweak a few aspects of that class- it just is not working how it should- and from what I have seen, does not meet the Galvanize Standard that I am use to. Until then, starting next week I'll be helping out regularly there too.

Wednesday night an old friend from HS was coming for dinner- so I spent the day cleaning up and grooming Rexy.

Mid day, I met Zac for lunch at Denver Beer Co. Food truck was stir fry! It was really good, and so nice outside.

Dinner was fun, and we found ourselves looking through year books - remembering random stuff and being super happy that we're not still in high school (because awful).

Thursday was another beautiful day. A friend who lives in the complex had taken the day off- so we sat up on the rooftop balcony and got some sun. Leo, her dog, is such a cuddler. He did not care that it was like 80 degrees in full sun- he was happy to curl up in my lap.

After, Rex and I got some work done outside. BECAUSE ALL THE SUN PLEASE.

Thursday night I TAed for Free Code Camp and had a blast. I highly suggest it to Galvanize Students. Everyone was at different points in learning, but it was fun to engage and talk through various problems.

By Friday, I realized that my ideal week didn't happen. I had been hitting the gym at 9pm instead of 6am, hadn't finished any projects and definitely didn't refactor anything from Q1. But- it was super successful and needed.

Over the weekend we relaxed. Got lattes, made pancakes and generally took it easy before I head back for Q2.

Fun fact is that I cannot make pancakes. Listen- I don't know. I just don't know what I do wrong EVERY time. So- after many failed attempts, Zac is the official pancake maker here.

We rented Passengers Saturday night- it was SO GOOD. Way different than I expected- I love it when a trailer doesn't tell you the full story.

Sunday is run-day, and we did a family run! I think we all did really good. Running in Denver is rough. We finished our three miles and felt pretty accomplished.

Sunday afternoon we grabbed groceries, and did a little meal prep. THEN it was time for TWD! I can't believe next week is the season finale.... ANXIETY!
