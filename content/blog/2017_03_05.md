Last Sunday was a prepare for the week day! Steph and Geoff had just left on Saturday, so I spend Sunday catching up around the house, grabbing groceries, and mostly meal prepping!

We stopped at the container store, and Zac ensured that I *contained myself*. Still my fav.

Monday night was craft night! I headed over to Cojo's with my banner supplies for Stephs Shower!

Tuesday night Zac and I did some work while on the couch. I realized I hadn't watch a SINGLE SUPERNATURAL since gSchool started. WHICH IS CRAZY. How will I ever catch up at this rate? So I put that on..

Wednesday night Zac went to a Learn to Code Colorado meetup with me. I'll be TA-ing a class this month, and wanted to get some hands on experience. It was also great because Zac got to meet some of my instructors and peers.

Zac snagged a picture of me in my natural element (because helping)

Thursday after class/work we went to the gym at the Galvanize/Pivotal building. After getting my moves in, Zac and I did a row OFF! It was fun, but mostly it was hard, lol.

Next thing we knew it was FRIDAY! I wore my new CF shirt.

Mel and Cody planned a layover in Denver on their way to Mexico for their honeymoon! Zac met them at the airport at 6; and at 7 we headed to Avanti for dinner!

Then it was time to head back to the airport! We grabbed icecream from Milkbox at union first.

I had the MOST AMAZING flavor. Seriously. Try it.

It was the shortest visit, but it was good to see them and hug them! I hope they have a great vacation in sunny Mexico!

Speaking of SUN, our weather has been kind of crazy this week. But it hasn't been awful, and we had some SPECTACULAR days.

Saturday- I hack-a-thon-ed. Read that post for details!

After we met up with Joe and his family for a quick dinner and some Ciders. They have seriously cute kids, and I had fun playing with them!

Then I slept, like a lot. On Sunday I WAS DEAD TIRED (even after a full nights sleep). So, we woke up late, went to the gym, and after a long day, ran errands.

I stopped by the library and returned my books. I also cancelled all my holds. I haven't read a single page in three weeks.  A SINGLE PAGE. Oh well.. in 5 months I'll be back at it, right?

When we got home, I meal prepped while listening to the new Ed Sheeran Album on Spotify. It's awesome.

I seriously can't explain how much simpler meal prepping makes the week. It's an investment on Sunday, but there is NO way I could eat healthy like this during the week otherwise. Here is a day(insert smoothie):

Life is PRETTY CRAZY around here, but I am loving every bit of it.
