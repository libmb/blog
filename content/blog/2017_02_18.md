So this past week was my first at Galvanize, but there was time outside of class! I'm going to try to break up my posts between school work, and life outside of class..

This past week Zac was in Portland, so every night we caught up on my day! I think he was as excited as me that I started school.

Monday I came home and just relaxed. All week it was really great that I had easy meals ready to go.

Tuesday was Valentines day! Rex got a treat of course.

After Galvanize, I headed to the gym. A very nice lady decided to talk to me while I was on the elliptical. She was concerned that I was at the gym alone (also the only person in the gym) on Valentines. I explained that Zac was in Portland- but come on- who does that?

After going to the gym and talking to Zac, Rex and I watched some Twilight while working on some CLI Murder Mystery! It was a really fun way to practice command line.

Wednesday my new bag came! I ordered an everyday tote- it is awesome! It has all of these collapsable dividers and is the perfect size. I love it!

After the CodePen Meetup, I headed to the gym at Galvanize. It was totally empty, and it was nice to change up the scenery.

Thursday night Zac got home from Portland (and will be home for three weeks at least!!). I immediately had him run through a Git/Github exercise to explain some concepts for me. He's a sweet guy..

All week I stopped home for Rex at lunch. All week he would watch me eat before heading to the dog park. He pretty much moped- I think he misses all our fun weekday adventures- but we'll make it up on the weekends.

The meal planning/prepping was lifesaving. It was the only reason I had time this week! AND, this week I had grapefruit as M2. I realized it has been 10 years since I had a grapefruit, and I LOVE THEM. So, I need to eat those more.

It was a really great week. The weather was nice, and it felt good to be busy!
